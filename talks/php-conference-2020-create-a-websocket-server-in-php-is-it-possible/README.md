# [Create a WebSocket server in PHP, is it possible ?](https://phpconference.com/php-core-technology/create-a-websocket-server-in-php-is-it-possible/)

Today, WebSockets are more and more used in our projects. The real time they bring us allows to respond to new usages, to differentiate ourselves with new features. They are commonly tied to the Node.js and JavaScript ecosystem. Do you know it’s possible to create a WebSocket server or client using PHP ?

What are the available solutions ? Why do I need to create my own server/client ? Is PHP the right tool for that job ?

This talk’s goal is to present the current state in the PHP ecosystem and show using a real example how to build a viable implementation. Then, like we often heard, everything depends on the context, you are free to use that kind of tool in your project … or not !
